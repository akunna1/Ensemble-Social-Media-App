### Used sites:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ --> used to make fake API calls

### To use node.js for the backend:
- Node.js Backend: Set up Express server with a route to handle search queries and respond with filtered data
- React Frontend: Update fetchData to call Node.js backend instead of the placeholder API
- CORS: Ensure CORS is enabled in Node.js server to allow cross-origin requests from the React app
